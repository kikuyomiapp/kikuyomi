/// before a repository is kept, so adding one is deliberately two steps — [look] reads what is there
/// and returns without writing anything, and [accept] is what pins the key. Nothing else stores a
/// key, so a key can only ever arrive by somebody agreeing to it.
///
/// **An index is held in memory, not in the database.** §4.3's `repository` row keeps where a
/// repository is, who it is and its key; what it offers is a listing, re-read rather than stored.
/// That means the stored ETag is only sent when there is a cached index to compare against — sending
/// it on a cold start would invite a 304 answering a question the app cannot then answer, leaving it
/// holding nothing. So a refresh within a session is cheap and the first browse after a restart is
/// a full fetch. Persisting the listing is what would change that, and it needs a table §4.3 does
/// not have.
