/// Installing, removing and reloading extensions: the extension side of §3.9's lifecycle.

/// The repository door (§3.8) is not built yet, so the one way in is a folder: one holding a

/// signed. That is also what an author has open in an editor, which makes it the door worth having
/// first.
///
/// Three ways to reach such a folder, one per platform's habits:
///
/// - the platform's folder picker, which `UserFolders` already provides as a path on desktop and a
///   Storage Access Framework tree on Android;
/// - a path on the command line, for an edit-and-reload loop on a desktop;
/// - the app's own Extensions folder, which on iOS the Files app shows, since iOS can keep no folder
///   the listener picks elsewhere.
///
/// Whichever it is, the files are copied into storage the app owns (`ExtensionInstallFolder`) and the
/// install is recorded in the database, so the extension is still there after a restart. Where it came
/// from is recorded too, which is what [ExtensionLibrary.reload] reads to pick up an edit.
