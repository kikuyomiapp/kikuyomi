/// Installing an extension: the app's own copy of its files (§3.9).
///
/// "Installing downloads the package, verifies it, unpacks it into a versioned directory, and
/// registers its sources." This is the unpacking. Verifying is `readExtensionPackage`, and
/// registering is the app's, since only the app has a database.
///
/// The copy matters. An extension installed from a folder must still be there at the next start,
/// after the listener has moved the folder, revoked the app's access to it or — on Android, where a
/// chosen folder is a Storage Access Framework tree rather than a path — plugged the phone into a
/// computer and reorganised it. So the files are read once, at install, and kept in storage the app
/// owns. Where the extension came from is remembered separately, by the database, so that an author
/// can reload an edited folder on demand (§3.11's live reload, by hand until the repository door
/// arrives).
