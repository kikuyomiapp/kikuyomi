/// Fetching what a repository publishes (§3.8, §3.9).
///
/// Two documents: `repo.json`, which says who the repository is and what key it signs with, and
/// `index.json`, which says what it offers. Both go through the app's one transport, so a repository
/// gets the same User-Agent, timeouts, body limits and per-host rate limiting everything else does,
/// and a repository that stops answering fails the same way a source does.
///
/// **The index is cached by its ETag.** A listener with a dozen repositories refreshes all of them
/// on the same schedule, and an index that has not changed is the ordinary case. Sending the ETag
/// back turns that into a 304 and no body at all, which is the difference between a refresh costing
/// a few hundred bytes and costing a megabyte of JSON nobody needed.
///
/// **`repo.json` is fetched every time.** It is tiny, and it carries the signing key: a key rotation
/// is precisely the thing that must not be missed because a cached index looked unchanged (§3.8).
