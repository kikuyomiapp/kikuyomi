/// What a repository publishes about itself and what it offers (§3.2, §3.8, §3.9; ADR-0018).
///
/// A repository is an HTTPS location serving a `repo.json` — its name, its website and its signing
/// key — an `index.json` listing what it offers, and the packages and icons those entries point at.
///
/// **The point of the index is that browsing runs no code.** §3.9: it "repeats the essential
/// metadata so that the app can present and filter available extensions without downloading any
/// code". So an entry carries everything the permissions summary and the filters need — the domains
/// it will contact, its content rating, its sources, the contract version it needs — and the app
/// fetches one JSON file to show a whole repository.
///
/// **It is read as strictly as an extension's own output.** A repository is the same third party
/// the code is, over the same network. Every field is checked, anything unreadable fails the whole
/// document rather than half of it, and unknown fields are ignored so a later minor version still
/// reads. An entry's manifest fields go through the manifest's own decoder, so a field the two share
/// cannot drift apart.
///
/// **Signatures are carried and not yet checked** (ADR-0018). `publicKey` and `signature` are
/// required by the format from version 1, because adding them later would break every published
/// repository; verifying them belongs to the install path. Until that lands, a repository is trusted
/// no further than ADR-0017 trusts a folder.
