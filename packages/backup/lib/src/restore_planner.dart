/// Planning a restore: how a backup merges into a library that may already hold some of it.
///
/// docs/architecture.md gives restoring a purpose rather than rules. The library has to survive an
/// Android uninstall or an iOS re-sign (§5.1, Appendix A), so a restore must work on a fresh install.
/// It must also work on a library that is not empty, because a user may add a book, or press play,
/// before restoring. §4.4's identity rules decide what matches what. Everything else here is a choice
/// made where the documents are silent, and every choice follows one principle: a restore never loses
/// anything the user did, whether on this device or in the backup.

/// Plans restoring [backup] into [current], the library as it is now.
///
/// Matching follows §4.4 and ADR-0009. Sources match by their stable id, books by source and key,
/// and chapters, files, bookmarks and sessions within a matched book. Categories match by name,
/// since a name is how a user tells categories apart.
///
/// What the library lacks is added. A book the library does not have is restored whole, exactly as
/// backed up, and so are sources and categories. New categories keep their backed-up sort order in a
/// library with no categories yet, and otherwise go after the library's own, in the backup's order.
///
/// A book both have is merged. The documents say nothing about this, so the rules are conservative:
///
/// - Nothing is removed. Whatever the backup lacks stays as it is, and a restore never takes a book
///   out of the library, though it puts back a book the backup has in it.
/// - The book's progress goes to whichever side saved it more recently, and a tie keeps the
///   library's. A book never started here takes the backup's.
/// - A chapter's progress, its listened state and last position, goes the same way, with one
///   exception: a chapter with no progress never wins over one with some, however recent. A book added
///   again before restoring has fresh chapters, written just now with nothing listened, and they must
///   not wipe out what the backup remembers.
/// - A chapter the library lacks is restored only if it carries progress, the book's position or a
///   new bookmark, and it is restored marked removed from source. The library's chapter list is the
///   source's latest word, and §4.4 keeps a chapter the source stopped reporting in exactly that way
///   while it carries user data. Restoring chapters without user data as live chapters would duplicate
///   any the source has since renamed.
/// - Details stay as the library has them, being what the source said most recently. The exception is
///   a field the user edited in the backup and not here: it takes the backup's value and stays marked
///   as edited, since §4.4 already ranks a user's edit above anything a source says. Where both sides
///   edited a field, the library's edit wins.
/// - A remembered speed stays. A book with none takes the backup's.
/// - Bookmarks and sessions are added unless already there. A bookmark is the same one when its
///   chapter, position and creation time match; a session when its device, start and end match, since
///   one device cannot be in two sessions at once.
/// - A book's existing files, chapter layouts and credits are left alone. Files are added only where a
///   restored chapter needs them.
///
/// Reconciling two devices that both kept listening is not a restore's job. ADR-0011 gives it to sync,
/// which will need rules that this planner deliberately does not attempt.
///
/// [formatVersion] is the version of the backup file [backup] was read from. A backup from before
/// [backupListenedRecordedSince] says no chapter is listened, even one the listener finished, so its
/// plan asks for listened state to be worked out from the positions it restores
/// ([RestorePlan.listenedFromPositions]). Taking such a backup as written would put every finished
/// book back on Continue Listening. A newer backup's listened state is restored as written, so a
/// chapter the listener marked not listened stays so, wherever its position is.
