/// A library as backup and restore exchange it: immutable values with no database ids.
///
/// Two packages meet here. The `backup` package writes snapshots into backup files and plans restores
/// from them; the data package reads snapshots from the database and writes restores into it. §2.4
/// lets neither depend on the other, so the values they share live in the domain, just as
/// `PlaybackStore` joins playback to the database. ADR-0008 already defines the backup format in
/// terms of domain values rather than tables.
///
/// A snapshot is not the backup format itself. The protobuf messages a backup file is written in are
/// mutable, full of `Int64`s, and unable to tell a missing value from a default except field by
/// field, so they never leave the `backup` package's codec.
///
/// A snapshot refers to things by the identities §4.4 defines, as the format does: a source by its
/// stable id, a book by its source and key, chapters and files by key within their book, and
/// categories by name. That is what lets a snapshot of one library be compared with, and restored
/// into, another.
///
/// Lists are not copied on the way in. Whoever builds a snapshot hands over lists it will not change
/// afterwards.
