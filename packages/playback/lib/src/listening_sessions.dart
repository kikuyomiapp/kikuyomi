/// Turns playback into listening sessions, per §6.4: each play-to-pause span becomes a
/// `listening_session` for history and statistics.
///
/// Like the progress tracker, it returns what to persist and writes nothing.
///
/// A play-to-pause span does not map onto one row as cleanly as §6.4 suggests, because a row has a
/// single chapter, a single speed, and one start and end position. So a span is **split**, ending
/// one session and starting the next at the same instant, whenever:
///
/// - playback crosses into another chapter, so history can say which chapter was listened to;
/// - the speed changes, so each row's speed is true for its whole length;
/// - the user seeks, so each row's start and end positions describe a stretch actually heard,
///   rather than bracketing a jump.
///
/// Splitting never changes the total time listened; it only makes each row honest.
///
/// Sessions shorter than [minimumLength] are dropped. Scrubbing back and forth while playing
/// produces a burst of splits a second or two long each, and those would bury real history without
/// adding meaningful time to any statistic. A clock set backwards produces a negative length and is
/// dropped for the same reason.
