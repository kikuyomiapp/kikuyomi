///
/// A backup is the listener's library (ADR-0008), and restoring one must not depend on anything a
/// restore cannot put back:
///
/// - `extensions` is what is installed *on this device*. A backup carries no extension code, and the
///   folder a folder-installed extension came from means nothing on the device being restored to.
///   Naming the extensions a restored library wants is worth doing — it is how a restore can offer to
///   install them again — but that needs somewhere to install them from, so it waits for the
///   repository door and a backup format version of its own.
/// - `extension_preferences` is one extension's own storage, keyed by an extension that may not be
///   installed. It follows the extensions.
const backupLeavesOut = ['extensions', 'extension_preferences'];

/// A signal after every committed change to what a backup carries: the library, chapters, progress,
/// listening sessions, bookmarks and categories.
///
/// What the backup scheduler listens to, to know that a backup is due. A signal carries nothing,
/// because the scheduler only needs to know that something changed; the backup reads the library
/// afresh. Progress saves arrive every few seconds during playback, and the scheduler, not this, is
/// what keeps them from causing a backup each.
